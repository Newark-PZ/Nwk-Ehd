# NgMaps

This is a modified version of the [ngx-openlayers](https://github.com/quentin-ol/ngx-openlayers) package. Mainly to make it more amenable to angular 9.x and the @types/ol package. I take no credit for the general framework and code of this package, but edited it enough that it could be breaking for others. I'm not an expert coder so message me if you feel this is inappropriate. I want to continue seeing development of open source web-mapping libraries.

Library generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ng-maps` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ng-maps`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ng-maps` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build ng-maps` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ng-maps`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ng-maps` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ng-maps` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
