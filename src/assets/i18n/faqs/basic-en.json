        "Answer": "<p><strong>No.</strong> On March 19, 2020, New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a>, which immediately suspends evictions throughout the state. This is called an “eviction moratorium,” and it means that, except in rare circumstances, <strong>no tenant may be removed from his or her home as a result of an eviction proceeding</strong>. This state eviction moratorium does <strong>not</strong> affect court proceedings; instead, it prevents lockouts and removals. The New Jersey Supreme Court controls court proceedings related to eviction, which are suspended for now. More information is below.</p>",

The landlord must comply with such a request. If the tenant causes damage to the apartment (beyond ordinary wear and tear), the landlord may require the tenant to pay for that damage if and when the landlord would otherwise have been entitled to recoup the cost from the security deposit. If the lease is renewed, the landlord may also require the tenant to post a new security deposit either six months after the end of the Public Health Emergency or when the lease is renewed, whichever is later.</p>",

        "Question": "Does federal law prevent my landlord from filing an eviction case against me?",
        "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> The federal <a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr748/text'>CARES Act</a> prohibited covered landlords (see below) from filing an eviction complaint for nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. If a landlord covered by the CARES Act filed such an eviction complaint during this period, the tenant can request that the case be dismissed. A dismissal will not stop the landlord from filing a new complaint, and the court may allow the landlord to certify compliance with the CARES Act to avoid dismissal of the complaint (see below).</p><p>Landlords covered by the CARES Act include:</p><ul><li>Those who hold a federally backed mortgage, such as a mortgage from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration.</li><li>Those who rent to federally subsidized tenants, including tenants who:</li><li>live in public housing,</li><li>have a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher,</li><li>live in Section 8 project-based housing, or</li><li>live in other types of federally funded housing, including, among others, certain housing programs for seniors, people with disabilities, people with HIV/AIDS, and people at risk of homelessness.</li><li>The National Low-Income Housing Coalition has constructed a <a href='https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums'>searchable database</a> of many (but not all) of the properties covered by the CARES Act.</li></ul><p>After July 25, covered landlords who <span>want to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent must first serve the tenant with a notice giving the tenant 30 days to vacate. The CARES Act states that a landlord</span> may not “require the tenant to vacate” the property until 30 days after giving the tenant a notice to vacate. In New Jersey, a landlord may not require a tenant to leave his or her home except through a court proceeding. Under the CARES Act, therefore, a covered landlord must give New Jersey tenants 30 days’ notice before such a court proceeding. In any case, a lockout cannot happen until the moratorium under <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a> is lifted.</p><p>As noted above, the CARES Act ban on eviction filings by covered landlords expired on July 25. Tenants should know, however, that the CARES Act also prohibited covered landlords from charging fees (such as late fees or attorney’s fees) related to nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. Tenants in covered properties do not owe such fees.</p><p>The CARES Act gives tenants additional protection if they live in a building with five or more units and the owner got permission to delay payments on a federally backed mortgage loan. In that case, the owner may not file an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, or charge late fees related to nonpayment of rent, during the period when the owner is not making mortgage payments. When this period ends, the owner must give tenants 30 days’ notice before taking the tenant to court to get an order requiring the tenant to vacate the property (but the lockout cannot happen in any case until the moratorium under <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a> is lifted).</p><p>The New Jersey Supreme Court has required landlords to <a href='https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200724a.pdf?c=DfF'>certify their compliance with the CARES Act</a>.</p>",

        "Answer": "<p>You always have a right to <a href='https://www.lsnjlaw.org/Housing/Landlord-Tenant/Repairs-Habitability/Pages/Safe-Decent-Housing.aspx>safe and decent housing</a>. If you have concerns about issues such as inadequate heat, exposure to lead, infestations, leaks, crumbling walls and ceilings, or other hazardous conditions, you should ask your landlord in writing to make repairs (keep a copy). If repairs are not made quickly, you can call 2-1-1, contact the state <a href='https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/offices/housinginspection.html'>Bureau of Housing Inspection</a>, or call your municipality to report the problem. Due to closures, enforcement agencies may be working with limited staff and it may take longer to get repairs or inspections. As an alternative, if you can manage the repairs on your own, and your landlord fails to respond to your requests for repairs, you can make them or pay someone to make them. You can then withhold the money you spent on repairs from your rent (save all receipts for the repairs!).</p>",

DCA encourages subsidized tenants to use the online portal at <a href='https://www.assistancecheck.com/'>assistancecheck.com</a> to submit documents, or to send documents through the mail (keep copies!). Subsidized tenants who have questions can contact the field offices or use the main customer service line: 609-292-4080 or <a href='mailto:customer.service@dca.nj.gov'>customer.service@dca.nj.gov</a>. <a href='https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200319c.shtml'>DCA has announced</a> that it has taken a number of actions to meet the ongoing needs of its clients and to curb evictions and homelessness during the state of emergency. For example, DCA has suspended termination of subsidies in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher and State Rental Assistance Programs, unless the tenant has engaged in violence or threats against others. DCA is also accepting through its online portal interim income re-certifications for tenants who have lost income because of the pandemic.</p>",

        "Question": "Is the Newark Housing Authority allowed to evict me now?",
        "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe</strong>. As noted above, the federal <a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr748/text'>CARES Act</a> prevented public housing authorities from filing eviction actions for nonpayment of rent against public housing tenants for a period of 120 days from March 27 (or through July 25, 2020). After July 25, the Act requires public housing authorities to give tenants 30 days’ notice before going to court to require them to leave their homes based on the tenants’ nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. If the <a href='http://www.newarkha.org/'>Newark Housing Authority</a> manages your rental subsidy, you are also covered by city-level anti-eviction protections.</p>",

The utilities and water companies are not cancelling debts; they are just postponing shutoffs for the time being. DCA offers low-income tenants <a href='https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dhcr/offices/hea.html'>assistance with some utility bills</a>, and you can call the customer service number on your utility bill to try to work out a payment plan.</p>",
