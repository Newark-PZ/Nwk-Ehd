    {
        "Answer": "<p>For users 18 and older, there will not be a helmet requirement. There are two main reasons for this:</p><ol><li>First, requiring helmets sharply decreases the number of cyclists and micromobility riders on the streets, which makes streets less safe by diluting the <a href='https://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/02/27/safety-in-numbers-biking-is-safest-in-nations-with-the-most-people-on-bikes/'>“safety in numbers” effect</a>. NACTO has pushed back on these laws as recently <a href='https://nacto.org/2019/11/08/helmet-laws/'>as last year</a>.</li><li>Second, a mandatory helmet statute, by reducing the number of customers using a micromobility service, jeopardizes the financial viability of service providers. This has resulted in the collapse of micromobility programs in other cities, <a href='https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/09/05/helmet-scolds-could-unwittingly-undermine-bike-safety-in-seattle/'>such as Seattle</a>.<ul><li>That said, users are encouraged to wear helmets, and many providers hand out free helmets as part of their education and outreach.</li></ul></li></ol>",
