This ground-breaking law requires companies and other applicants that want to work in Newark to prove they are not adding to Newark’s existing pollution. The law highlights the fact that Newark has long been subject to extreme levels of industrial pollution that is harmful to the health of those who live and work here. As part of the Ordinance, applicants proposing new development or modification of an existing development who are also required to apply for an environmental permit from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection or whose application is considered a significant land-use change, are required to fill out an additional form that the Environmental Commission reviews. The Environmental Commission then provides written commentary to the Central Planning Board and Zoning Board of Adjustment. Additionally, the Environmental Commission is working on developing an Environmental Resource Inventory which is a comprehensive analysis of Newark’s existing environmental health.</p>"
